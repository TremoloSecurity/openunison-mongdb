= MongoDB Integration

The MongoDB integration is designed to be used within OpenUnison and MyVD primarily as a way of adding additional data to 
an existing directory such as new attributes and groups.  It is not designed to replace an existing directory.

== Virtual Directory Insert

The MongoDB insert provides search capabilities via LDAP of a mongodb database.  Each collection maps to an OU.  Each document MUST have two attributes:

* unisonRdnAttributeName - The name of the attribute that stores the rdn of the directory object
* The attribute named in unisonRdnAttributeName

While not strictly required, an objectClass attribute should also be present for the objects to work consistently with LDAP.

At this time ONLY search capabilities are implemented.  For updates and modifications, see the provisioning target.
